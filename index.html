        <h1>My Tech Goals For The Next Two Years</h1>
        <p class="second-paragraphs-paragraph">
            Over the next two years, I aim to master JavaScript and its 
            frameworks, such as React and Node.js, while deepening my understanding 
            of Java with a focus on advanced concepts and design patterns. I plan to learn 
            a new programming language, such as Python or Rust, and gain proficiency in cloud
             platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. In web development, I will build and 
             deploy full-stack applications, emphasizing modern practices like responsive design,
              web accessibility, and performance 
            optimization. My project goals include creating substantial portfolio pieces, 
            developing and launching a SaaS application, and contributing to open-source projects. I will complete the B2B software for advertisements, progressing it to beta testing to gather user feedback. Professionally, I aim to network by attending tech events and connecting with industry professionals. I plan to earn certifications in cloud computing and project management while developing scripts to automate tasks and create API integrations. Securing internships or part-time jobs in tech will help me gain real-world experience, ultimately leading to a full-time software engineering position post-graduation. Additionally, I will support my sister in learning a high-income skill and mentor her progress. To stay updated, I will continuously learn through blogs, podcasts, and online courses.</p>
